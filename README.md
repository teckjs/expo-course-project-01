## Installing NodeJS
Get started with Node to use everything in the JS ecosystem, including Expo and React Native. We recommend using the latest Node version.

## Get the command-line tool
You will run this tool locally to package, serve, and publish your projects.

```
$ npm install expo-cli --global
```

## Create your first project
You will be asked to create an Expo account before proceeding.

```
$ expo init project-01 --npm
$ cd project-01
$ expo start
```

## Preview your project
* Open http://localhost:19002
* Run an android emulator or IOS simulator.
* Press "Run on Android device/emulator" or "Run on iOS simulator"

### Or you can simply:
* Open Expo Client on your device.
* Scan the QR code printed by expo start with Expo Client (Android) or Camera (iOS).
* You may have to wait a minute while your project bundles and loads for the first time.

## Start coding!
Select your favorite editor, in our case it is VSCode. Open project-01/App.js, and start building!
To show you some interesting things we do all the needed changes to have code and assets inside a unique src folder. Then we play with the application by suggesting a clean way to refer assets in react native and styling the application main screen with the icon.
